To obtain the google recaptcha api keys navigate to the below url

https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin#list

Step1. register the new site by entering
	a. label name
	b. select the recaptcha type as "recaptcha v2" -> "I'm not a robot" checkbox
	c. domain as "localhost"
	d. click submit
	
once this is done the two api keys would be generated (i.e. site-key and secret-key)

notes - 
	a. site-key will be used at the client-side
	b. secret-key will be used at the backend-code
	
	Public site key = "6LcbfGIkAAAAAHbVDyAcINmlve0pRqJD0H18nhI8"
	Secret Key = "6LcbfGIkAAAAAJdRgIUXMT7qxlCqTEK9-etvICXJ"
